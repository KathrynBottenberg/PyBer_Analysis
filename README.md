##Purpose:

Use Python and Pandas to create summary dataframes for ride-sharing by city types. Use matplotlib to create a line graph in order to show the total fares of each city type by weeks. This chart will help decision makers at Pyber see the data in a readable matter so they can look at the differences in different city types and help them make certain decisions.
